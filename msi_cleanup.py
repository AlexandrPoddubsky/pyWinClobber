This script performs cleanup of Windows Installer cache trying to be as safe as possible:
it removes only *.msi/*.msp files that are not references as installed on the system (most
likely some leftover junk after unsuccessful installations).

If you break your Windows Installer cache here's a link to MS blog describing the way to fix it:
