This script performs DriverStorage cleanup removing possible staged driver duplicates.
The operation should be safe as it utilizes MS pnputil.exe to do the job, and the mode
in which the util is used forbids removing the driver that is currently used for installed
devices.

For more information see "pnputil.exe -?"
